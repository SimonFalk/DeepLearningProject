# dl_project_21
The project for the course Deep Learning for Data Science. 
By Simon Falk and Gustav RÃ¶hss. 

### Done so far:
Data collection.
Setting up of computational resources.
Initial mini-experiments with LSTM, CNNs on signal and spectrogram data for intuition about software and methods.

### Dataset sources:

### To do:
<ul>
	<li>Data accessing utilities (in progress). -- Gustav</li>
	<li>Set up cloud storage for data (check) -- Simon</li>
	<li>(Bidirectional) LSTM for simultaneous mutli-channel signal prediction. -- Gustav</li>
	<li>(Bidirectional) LSTM for spectrogram prediction. -- Simon</li>
	<li>CNN for prediction from/of spectrogram data. ResNet architecture strong candidate.</li>
</ul>
